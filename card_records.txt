Before adding any code I want to review some initial record types and how they're formatted.

The card file is a text file that consistes of text only lines organized into cards.

Each card begins with a line containing a unique identifing number as follows:
serial:=nnnnn
where n is one or more digits
the card consists of all the lines until the next serial:=nnnn is encountered.

blank lines are ignored

lines comprising a card can be one or more of each of the following:
name:=some displayable text
comment:=some displayable text
